# hello-world

I am an overly emotional, unemotional, clingy, but distant, private person, who likes to overshare at any moment, and I'm still trying to figure out how that works.

I believe in intuition, hard work, dreams, kindness, and gratitude. I believe that art is to the soul what food is to the body. I believe in imperfections, and miracles, and the power of noticing and appreciating the ordinary.

Simply stated, I am a lover of words, jazz music, and espresso.
